<div>
    Choose the timespan and on which days a minimum number of instances should be kept alive. If the To-time is before the From-time, the time range will wrap around to the next day.

    E.g. From 23:00 to 06:00 with Monday selected would mean that the instance(s) would be kept up from 23:00 on Monday evening until 06:00 Tuesday morning.
